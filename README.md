# workers-management
This is my diploma project. So it should be finished until end of may 2021. 

The following describes the purpose of folders and files in the hierarchy

/

  /img
    img folder is for images as it says. There are stored mainly icons for the application.
    
  /page
    So there I have patterns of my pages as app just dinamically loads them.
    
  /scripts
    scripts folder is for scripts as it says.
      menu.js - functional and decorative stuff regarding sidebar menu.
      page_management.js - for dinamically loading pages
      
  index.php - the main page of the app, there are no other.
  style.css - styles for all the pages, later will maybe use scss if it is possible.
